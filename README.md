###### Functional and non-functional requirements are vital in defining what a system should do (functional) and how it should perform (non-functional). Here's a breakdown of their relationship:

## Functional Requirements
Definition: Functional requirements describe specific functionalities or tasks the system should perform.
Examples:
* User Authentication: The system should allow users to log in securely using a username and password.
* Password Entry Creation: Users should be able to create, update, and delete password entries.
* Access Control: Admins should have exclusive access to manage user accounts and password data.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Definition: Non-functional requirements define the system's attributes, such as performance, security, reliability, and usability.
Examples:
* Security: Passwords must be stored securely using encryption techniques.
* Performance: The system should respond within two seconds for password retrieval requests.
* Usability: The interface should be intuitive and accessible for users with varying technical expertise.
Relationship
* Interdependence: Functional and non-functional requirements are interdependent and complement each other.
* Supporting Role: Non-functional requirements support the fulfillment of functional requirements.
Example: Security (non-functional) is essential to ensure the functionality of secure password storage (functional).
#### Importance
* Both Essential: Both functional and non-functional requirements are crucial for delivering a successful system.
* Balancing Act: Balancing functional and non-functional requirements is key for achieving a system that meets user needs while performing reliably and securely.
#### Alignment
* Aligned Objectives: Meeting functional requirements contributes to achieving non-functional objectives.
Example: Implementing password entry creation (functional) aligns with ensuring secure storage (non-functional) of the entered passwords.
#### Development Focus
* Development Priorities: While functional requirements drive the features developed, non-functional requirements guide how those features are implemented.
* Holistic Approach: A well-balanced system considers both functional and non-functional aspects throughout the development lifecycle.


In summary, functional requirements outline what the system should do, while non-functional requirements define how the system should perform to meet user expectations, security, and usability standards. Both are essential for delivering a robust, user-friendly, and reliable system.

###### Certainly! When focusing specifically on the admin interface for a password management system, here's a breakdown of functional and non-functional requirements:

### Functional Requirements for Admin Interface:
####User Management:

* Create, edit, deactivate admin accounts.
* Assign roles and permissions for accessing password data and managing user accounts.
####Password Entry Management:

* Create, update, delete password entries.
* Allow admins to view and manage password details, including related information like name, username, URL, and notes.
#### Security and Access Control:

* Ensure only authorized admins have access to sensitive password data.
* Implement secure authentication mechanisms for admin logins.
#### Customization and Configuration:

* Allow admins to configure system-wide settings related to password policies, encryption standards, and audit logs.
#### Reporting and Audit:

* Generate reports on admin activities, password access logs, and system health.
* Provide audit trails for tracking changes made by admins to password entries or user accounts.
## Non-Functional Requirements for Admin Interface:
#### Security:

* Implement robust encryption methods to safeguard stored password data.
* Enforce strong authentication measures to prevent unauthorized access.
#### Performance:

* Ensure the admin interface is responsive and performs well even with a large volume of password entries or user accounts.
#### Usability:

* Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies password management tasks for admins.
* Provide clear and informative feedback for admin actions and system status.
#### Reliability:

* Maintain system uptime and availability to ensure admins can access and manage password data whenever needed.
* Implement backup mechanisms to prevent data loss and facilitate recovery in case of failures.
#### Scalability:

* Design the admin interface to scale efficiently as the number of password entries and users grows.
#### Compliance:

* Ensure compliance with security standards (e.g., encryption protocols, data protection regulations) relevant to password management.

Focusing solely on the admin interface for a password management system requires meticulous attention to both functional aspects (what the admin can do) and non-functional aspects (how well the admin interface performs in terms of security, usability, reliability, etc.). Both types of requirements are crucial for delivering a robust and user-friendly admin experience for managing sensitive password data.




## Functional Requirements for User Management:
#### User Authentication:

* Allow users to securely log in using their credentials (username/email and password).
Implement password reset and recovery mechanisms for users.
#### User Account Management:

* Enable users to create, update, and delete their accounts.
* Provide options for users to modify their profile information.
#### Access Control:

* Define different user roles (e.g., regular user, administrator) and permissions for accessing password data.
#### Password Entry Access:

* Allow users to view and retrieve their stored password entries securely.
* Enable users to create, update, and delete their own password entries.
##Non-Functional Requirements for User Management:
####Security:

* Ensure user authentication processes are robust and secure, safeguarding user login credentials.
* Encrypt sensitive user information and passwords stored within the system.
#### Usability:

* Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with their password data easily.
* Provide clear instructions and guidance for managing password entries and account settings.
#### Performance:

* Ensure the user interface remains responsive, even with large volumes of stored password entries.
* Optimize user workflows to minimize delays in accessing or managing password data.
####Reliability:

```

- **Description**:
  - The sequence begins with the user initiating a login request through the admin interface.
  - The admin interface performs user authentication using the `authenticateUser()` method.
  - Upon successful authentication, the user requests to view a password entry.
  - The admin interface retrieves password data by calling `retrievePassword()` from the Password Entry Module.
  - The password data is returned to the admin interface.
  - Subsequently, the user updates a password entry.
  - The admin interface updates the password using `updatePassword()` in the Password Entry Module.
  - Confirmation of the password update is sent back to the admin interface.
  - Finally, the user initiates a logout, leading to the termination of the session in the admin interface.

This sequence diagram showcases the flow of interactions between the user, the admin interface, and the Password Entry Module for managing a password entry within the system. The depicted sequence can be extended or modified to represent various scenarios or use cases within your password management system.
